### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223060153
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for Iris Flower.
###  Algorithm:
1.Load the Iris dataset and separate features (X) and labels (y).
2.Split the data into training and testing sets (80:20).
3.Normalize the feature values using StandardScaler.
4.Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.
5.Predict the flower classes for the test data.
6.Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report.
### Program:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Accuracy
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


### Output:

### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
